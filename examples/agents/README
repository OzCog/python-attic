                             Example Agent
                            ----------------

In OpenCog, an "Agent" is a bit of code that is run repeatedly, on a
regular schedule.  The CogServer maintains a list of active Agents, and
calls themm on a periodic basis.  This directory provides an example of
how an agent can be written in C++.  

To test this agent, do the following:

*) Start the cogserver: From a shell prompt, issue the command 
   ./opencog/server/cogserver from the build directory

*) Connect to the server: telnet localhost 17001

*) At the cogserver prompt, issue the command:
   opencog> loadmodule examples/atomtypes/libexample_agent.so
   You should see 'done' printed on a line by itself.

*) At the cogserver prompt, issue the command 'listmodules', and verify
   that the module was loaded. The module will be called
   opencog::ExampleModule, and so you should see:
   Filename: libexample_agent.so, ID: opencog::ExampleModule

*) At the cogserver prompt, issue the command 'agents-list', and verify
   that the example agent is one of those available.  You should see the
   following printed:
   opencog::ExampleAgent

*) At the cogserver prompt, issue the command 'agents-active', and verify
   that the example agent is running.  You should see the following
   printed:
   opencog::ExampleAgent {""}

*) Stop the example agent. At the cogserver prompt, issue the command 
   'agents-stop opencog::ExampleAgent', and verify thaat the example
   agent stopped (by issuing 'agents-active' again).
