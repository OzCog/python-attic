Python Examples
===============
There are more basic examples in the atomspace repository.

To run these examples, you must first set the `PYTHONPATH` to the
opencog cython build directory.  In most cases, the following will
suffice:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/share/opencog/python:../../build/opencog/cython
```
