                      Custom Atom Types Example
                      -------------------------

Demonstrates how to add new, custom atom types to the cogserver.
The new atom types are defined in atom_types.script.
They are created when the example module is loaded. 

To load this module, and use the atom types, to this:

*) start the cogserver: ./opencog/server/cogserver from the build directory

*) connect to the server: telnet localhost 17001

*) At the cogserver prompt, issue the command: 
   opencog> loadmodule examples/atomtypes/libcustomatomtypes.so
   You should see 'done' printed on a line by itself.

*) At the cogserver prompt, issue the command 'listmodules', and verify
   that the module was loaded.

*) Use the new atom types.  During compilation, a scheme wrapper for
   the new atom types should have been created, in the build directory
   ./examples/atomtypes/example_types.scm

   Load this file.  From a shell prompt, say:
   cat examples/atomtypes/example_types.scm | telnet localhost 17001

*) Use the new atom types. From the cogserver prompt, start the scheme
   shell, and create some atoms:

   opencog> scm
   guile> (FooNode "asdf")
   (FooNode "asdf")

   guile> (define xxx (ListLink (FooNode "hee") (BarNode "haw")))

   guile> xxx
   (ListLink
      (FooNode "hee")
      (BarNode "haw")
   )

   guile> 

That's all folks .. the rest is up to you.
