Pattern Matcher Examples
------------------------

See `../guile/README` for for an intro on running the guile shell needed
to run the demos here.

The first set of demos provide a basic introduction to various
main features.

* simple.scm: a basic introduction to pattern matching.
* gsn.scm: calling arbitrary functions upon a match.
* gpn.scm: calling arbitrary functions to decide a match.

Some simpler applications showing some things one can do, and how to do
them.

* fsm-basic.scm: A simple Finite State Machine demo.
* fsm-full.scm: A generic finite-state-machine constructor
* markov-chain.scm: A Markov chain (probabilistic FSM) based on above.
