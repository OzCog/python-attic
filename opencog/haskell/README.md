Haskell FFI for OpenCog
-----------------------

Someday in the distant future, this directory will contain Haskell
bindings for the OpenCog C++ AtomSpace, and other parts of OpenCog.
Currently, it is a sandbox for toys and badly-implemented ideas.


Notes:
------
There is going to be friction betweeen Cabal and CMake.

CMake infrastructure:
https://bitbucket.org/arrowdodger/cmake-findcabal/src
https://github.com/kvanberendonck/cmake-haskell

The github version claims to be a better rewrite of the bitbucket
version.

Maybe should not use Cabal at first ...
