                 Haskell FFI for OpenCog
                 -----------------------

Someday in the distant future, this directory will contain Haskell
bindings for the OpenCog C++ AtomSpace, and other parts of OpenCog.
Currently, it is a sandbox for toys and badly-implemented ideas.


Notes:
Should probably use Cabal for building and managing libraries??
