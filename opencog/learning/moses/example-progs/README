                   Example Programs for MOSES
                   --------------------------

This directory contains a set of example programs for MOSES, showing
how to use the MOSES algorithm and assorted infrastructure to solve
various common "textbook" problems with MOSES.

Some of these are better documented then others. Start reading here:

-- onemax.  This uses a scoring function that counts the number of ones
   in a bit string. The solver is supposed to find the optimal solution,
   which is a string of all ones.

   Usage: onemax <rand-seed> <bit-string-len> <population-size> <num-gens>

-- nmax. This uses a scoring function that totals up the values of a
   set of discrete variables. The solver should find as a solution the
   set where all of the variables have thier maximum value.  The onemax
   problem is a special case of this, with n=2.

   Usage: nmax <rand-seed> <set-size> <population-size> <num-gens> <arity>

   NOTE: There's currently a bug, this fails for n=2, see bug 908230.

-- continmax. This is a variation of the onemax/nmax problems above, but
   with continuous variables in place of discrete variables.

   NOTE: This sort-of works, but not well, I think due to bugs. See
