                   Example Programs for MOSES
                   --------------------------

This directory contains a set of example programs for MOSES, showing
how to use the MOSES algorithm and assorted infrastructure to solve 
various common "textbook" problems with MOSES. 

Some of these are better documented then others. Start reading here:

-- onemax.  This uses a scoring function that counts the number of ones
   in a bit string. The solver is supposed to find the optimal solution,
   which is a string of all ones.

   Usage: onemax <rand-seed> <bit-string-len> <population-size> <num-gens>
