                   Example Programs for MOSES
                   --------------------------

This directory contains a set of example programs for MOSES, showing
how to use the MOSES algorithm and assorted infrastructure to solve
various common "textbook" problems with MOSES.

Some of these are better documented then others. A synopsis of the
documented examples are given below.

Most/all of these examples don't demonstrate MOSES at all, but rather
exercise a certain compenent within MOSES. In most cases, this is the
optimizer, which implements a generic estimation-of-distribution
algorithm.  The MOSES meta-optimizer draws heavily on this component
to perform much of the "heavy lifting".

-- onemax.  This uses a scoring function that counts the number of ones
   in a bit string. The solver is supposed to find the optimal solution,
   which is a string of all ones.

   Usage: onemax <rand-seed> <bit-string-len> <population-size> <num-gens>

-- nmax. This uses a scoring function that totals up the values of a
   set of discrete variables. The solver should find as a solution the
   set where all of the variables have thier maximum value.  The onemax
   problem is a special case of this, with n=2.

   Usage: nmax <rand-seed> <set-size> <population-size> <num-gens> <arity>

   NOTE: There's currently a bug, this fails for n=2, see bug 908230.

-- continmax. This is a variation of the onemax/nmax problems above, but
   with continuous variables in place of discrete variables.

   NOTE: This sort-of works, but not well, I think due to bugs. See
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/opencog/+bug/908247

-- termmax. A variation of the continmax problem, but extended for
   arbitrary n-ary term-algebra trees.  term support in MOSES is 
   currently incomplete and non-functional.
