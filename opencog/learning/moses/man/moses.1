.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBmoses\fP is the command-line wrapper to the MOSES program learning
library. It may be used to solve learning tasks specified with file inputs,
or to run various demonstration problems.
.PP
.\" ============================================================
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options fall into two classes: those that are used to run \fBmoses\fP in
demo mode, and those used for practical problem solving.
.SS "General options"
.TP
.BI \-e\  exemplar
Specify an initial \fIexemplar\fR to use. Each exemplar is written in
combo. May be specified multiple times.
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Print help.
.TP
.BI \-j\  num_jobs
Number of jobs allocated for deme optimization.
Jobs can be executed on a remote machine as well,
in such case the notation \fB\-j\fR \fIN:REMOTE_HOST\fR is used,
where \fIN\fR is the number of jobs on the machine \fIREMOTE_HOST\fR.
For instance, one can enter the options
\fB\-j\fR4 \fB\-j\fR16:my_server.org
(or \fB\-j\fR16:user@my_server.org if one wishes to
run the remote jobs under a different user name),
meaning that 4 jobs are allocated on the local machine
and 16 jobs are allocated on my_server.org.
The assumption is that moses must be on the remote
machine and is located in a directory included in the
\fBPATH\fR environment variable. Beware that a lot of log
files are going to be generated when using this option on
the remote machines.

.\" ============================================================
.SS "Output control options"
These options control the displayed output.
.TP
.BI \-c\  count \fR,\ \fB\-\-result\-count= count
The number of non-dominated (best) results to return, ordered according
to score. If negative, then all results are returned, including the 
dominated results.
.TP
.BI \-o\  filename \fR,\ \fB\-\-output\-file= filename
Write results to \fIfilename\fR. If not specified, results are written to
\fBstdout\fR.
.TP
.BI \-S0\fR,\ \fB\-\-output\-score=0
Prevent printing of the score.
.TP
.BI \-t1\fR,\ \fB\-\-output\-bscore=1
Print the behavioural score.
.TP
.BI \-V1\fR,\ \fB\-\-output\-eval\-number=1
Print the number of evaluations performed.
.TP
.BI \-W1\fR,\ \fB\-\-output\-with\-labels=1
Use named labels instead of position placeholders when printing 
candidates. For example, *("#temperature" "#entropy") instead
of *(#3 #4). This option is effective only when the data file
contains labels in its header.
.TP
.BI \-x1\fR,\ \fB\-\-output\-complexity=1
Print the complexity score.
.\" ============================================================
.SS "Demo options"
These options pertain to the varius built-in demo and example modes.
.TP
.BI \-H\  type \fR,\ \fB\-\-problem\-type= type
A number of demonstration problems are supported. In each case, the top 
results are printed to stdout, as a score, followed by a combo program.
.I type
may be one of:
.TS
tab (@);
l lx.
\fBdj\fR@T{
Disjunction problem.
T}
\fBmux\fR@T{
Multiplex problem. 
T}
\fBpa\fR@T{
Even parity problem.  The resulting combo program computes the parity of k
bits, evaluating to true if the parity is even, else evaluating to false.
T}
.TE

The size of the demonstration problem may be specified with the -k flag.
.TP
.BI \-k\  size \fR,\ \fB\-\-problem\-size= size
Specify the size of the problem.
.PP
.\" ============================================================
.SH USE
.PP
\fBmoses\fR will run demo problems or solve real problems from data files.
