        -----------------------

This directory currently contains four subdirectories:

-- moses -- contains the code for the "meta-optimizing semantic
   evolutionary search" algorithm, used in several places inside
   opencog.

-- feature selection -- code that makes use of moses.

-- dimensionalembedding -- code that makes use of moses.

-- hillcimbing -- contains stale code, to be migrated to moses or
   elsewhere, as needed, and then removed.
