OpenCog Learning
================

Collection of learning algorithms, mostly operating on the AtomSpace
but not only. Here is a brief description of each folder

* `clustering` is supposed to be a collection of clustering algorithms
  but for now only contains an eigenvalue solver, BLOPEX for Block
  Locally Optimal Preconditioned Eigenvalue Xolvers.
* `dimensionalembedding` implements a method of dimensional embedding
  of the atomspace using the Harel-Koren algorithm.
* `pattern-index` implements Andre Senna prototype pattern indexing
  for the AtomSpace, used for fast pattern matching and mining.
