This directory uses Hypertable to support persistent and (eventually) distributed storage of atoms. Three things are needed in order for it to work:

1. Hypertable must be installed (of course).
2. The Hypertable servers must be running. The command to start them is:
        <install_dir>/bin/start-all-servers.sh <local | hadoop | kfs>
3. The table must be created through the hypertable shell. To start the shell:
        <install_dir>/bin/hypertable
   From the hypertable shell, run this command:
        CREATE TABLE Atomtable ( name, type, stv, outgoing, incoming, sti, lti, vlti );
