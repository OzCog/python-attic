Requirements:
 - Python 2.6 or later
 - Python-qt4 4.7.4 or later. http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/ 
 - Matplotlib 0.99 or later. http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

If you are using Ubuntu, just simply try:
  
  sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-matplotlib

In other linux distributions, both Python-qt4 and Matplotlib can be installed 
with easy_install:

  sudo easy_install pyqt matplotlib

Usage:

  $> python $PATH_TO_WORKBENCH/oc_workbench.py

You will see three modules, "Psi Monitor", "Language" and "Emotion Space", choose one
of them and start using it!

TODO:
  Workbench now is in experimental stage, so updates might happen in different revisions.
