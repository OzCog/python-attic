; Activation controls the agent's readiness for action. 
; The higher the activation, the pressing it has become to react to the situation at hand,
; and faster decisions are sought. 
; A higher activation would lead to few details and less schematic depth.

    (random:uniform)

;             ) 
;        ) 
;     )

; Resolution level affects perception. 
; The range of resolution level is [0, 1]
; A low resolution level tends to miss differences, then the agent would get a better overview

(define (ResolutionModulatorUpdater)
    (random:uniform) 
)

; The frequency of the securing behavior is inversily determined by SecuringThreshold.
; The range of securing threshold is [0, 1]
; The value of securing threshold is proportional to the strength of the current motive, 
; i.e. in the face of urgency, there will be less orientation. 
; It also depends on the uncertainty in the current context.
; An undetermined environment requires more orientation, i.e. lower securing threshold.

; SelectionThreshold is a bias added to the strength of the currently selected motive (Demand Goal). 
; The range of SelectionThreshold is [0, 1]
; A higher selection threshold leads to "stubbornness", makes it harder to switch motives (Demand Goals), 
; then oscillations can be avoided.
; While a lower one results in opportunism/flexibility, or even motive fluttering.
