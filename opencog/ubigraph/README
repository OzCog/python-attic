Ubigraph module (by Jared Wigmore <jared.wigmore@gmail.com>)

This module displays the atomspace via Ubigraph.

The code for converting the atomspace to a graph was adapted from the DottyModule by Trent Waddington <trent.waddington@gmail.com>.

== Dependencies ==

This module depends on the ubigraph server, and also the C client interface.

libubigraphclient.a
XMLRPC
libcurl
libm

== Running the module ==

First start the ubigraph server. Then load the libubigraph.so module in cogserver, and run the "ubigraph" command.
You should run the ubigraph command once, and then the display will update when atoms are added or removed.

== TODO ==

* Better error handling, especially for if the ubigraph command is run (or an add/remove atom signal happens) while the ubigraph server is not running.

* Possibly having a separate command to start the initial display vs to choose which things to show.

* Being able to choose to display only some of the atoms.

* "Themes" to display TruthValues and AttentionValues visually (e.g. as color or size).

* Make FindXMLRPC work correctly re the XMLRPC_LIBRARIES CMake variable.

* [related] Make the UbiGraph client library easier to compile and install.
