Ubigraph module (by Jared Wigmore <jared.wigmore@gmail.com>)

This module displays the atomspace via Ubigraph.

The code for converting the atomspace to a graph was adapted from the DottyModule by Trent Waddington <trent.waddington@gmail.com>.

== Dependencies ==

This module depends on the ubigraph server, and also the C client interface.

libubigraphclient.a
XMLRPC
libcurl
libm

== Running the module ==

First start the ubigraph server. Then load the libubigraph.so module in cogserver, and run the "ubigraph" command.
You should run the ubigraph command once, and then the display will update when atoms are added or removed.

== A note on screen captures ==

Required software: gtk-recordMyDesktop, mplayer, transcode, ffmpeg

Use gtk-recordMyDesktop. Don't enable compression... just save the ogv file
somewhere temporary (I found I needed to specify the file to save to before
doing the recording). Select the ubigraph server window.

Use mplayer to find out the video properties, since recordMyDesktop or the codec
it uses doesn't set these properly:

$ mplayer -vo null -ao null -frames 0 -identify [filename]

Then find out the width and height and use that in the transcode process:

$ transcode -i [filename] -x mplayer -o output.wmv -y \
ffmpeg -F wmv1 -g [width]x[height] -f 20

This creates a wmv (Windows mediaplayer video) file.

If you need to trim the borders, you can use the -j transcode option.

== TODO ==

* Better error handling, especially for if the ubigraph command is run (or an add/remove atom signal happens) while the ubigraph server is not running.

* Possibly having a separate command to start the initial display vs to choose which things to show.

* Being able to choose to display only some of the atoms.

* "Themes" to display TruthValues and AttentionValues visually (e.g. as color or size).

* Make FindXMLRPC work correctly re the XMLRPC_LIBRARIES CMake variable.

* [related] Make the UbiGraph client library easier to compile and install.
