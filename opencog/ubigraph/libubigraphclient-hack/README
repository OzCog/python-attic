Hack for compiling libubigraphclient

The libubigraphclient is included in the UbiGraph distribution, however its Makefile is currently very broken. In the meantime, here are the instructions to compile it.

* Go to the ubigraph/examples/C directory (where ubigraph is the root directory of the UbiGraph distribution).
* Replace the supplied Makefile with the modified one in this directory.
* add a link libcurl.so to /usr/lib/libcurl.so.4
* make libubigraphclient
* install the client library and the include file (which is in ubigraph/include)
