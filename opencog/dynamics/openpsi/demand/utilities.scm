  It associates an action and context in which the action has to be taken

  atomspace then the previous defined BindLink is returned.

  A single action-rule could only have a either of the effect-types, thus
  changing the effect-type will not have any effect if the action-rule has
  already been defined in the atomspace with a different effect-type.

  vars:
    - A list containing the VariableNodes, and their type restrictions, that
      are part of the context. If there is no type restrictions then pass empty
      list.

  context:
    - A list containing the terms/clauses that should be met for this action
      to be taken. Be careful on how you use Variable naming in the context

  action:
    - The Implicand of the rule. It should be an atom that uses the groundings
      of the context to do something.

  demand-name:
    - The name of the demand that is affected by the execution of the function
      associated with the action.
    - Shouldn't include `psi-prefix-str`
    - It is case sensetive, that is, a demand named `Energy` is not equal
      to a demand named `energy`. If you pass a name of a not defined node,
      since it's unrecognized it won't be run, eventhough a BindLink is
      returned.

  effect-type:
    - A string that describes the effect the particualr action would have on
      the demand value. The only options are `Increase` and `Decrease`.
