; Activation controls the agent's readiness for action.
; The higher the activation, the pressing it has become to react to the situation at hand,
; and faster decisions are sought.
; A higher activation would lead to few details and less schematic depth.

; This replaces what was done by the different StimulusUpdaterAgent
; If the factor is < 1 then the modulator values will continuesely decrease.
; XXX: What is the criteria for choosing the default factor value??
